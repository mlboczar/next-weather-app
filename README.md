This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, `npm install`

Sign up for an API key at [https://home.openweathermap.org/](https://home.openweathermap.org/)

Add a `.env` to your root directory with
```API_KEY = [YOUR API KEY]```
Ensure there are no quotes or anything around your key. It should just be the key itself.

Run `npm run dev`
